# learning-python
Now I begin to learn python,write down something which can be forgot easily.
# variable
Compared to other programing language,python's variables don't have types,and you can use '' to mean strings.
e.g. t1=5                     t1='5'
     t2=3                     t2='3'
     t3=t1+t2                 t3=t1+t2 
     and t3=8                 and t3='53'
# while for if else if
just like any other programing language.
